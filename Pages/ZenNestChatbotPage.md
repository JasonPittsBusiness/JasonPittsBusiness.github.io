Welcome to the ZenNest Chatbot assistant! This project leverages OpenAI's API to create a customer service chatbot for the ZenNest home system. The ZenNest home system is a futuristic home automation system that integrates with a chatbot assistant that aims to solve user issues quickly and efficiently. This chatbot was trained using Python, JSON training data, and integrated with Weights and Biases to record training results. Following along with this project, you will gain a basic understanding of working with LLMs, specifically OpenAI's API, to achieve desired results. For detailed instructions check out the [readme](https://github.com/JasonPittsBusiness/ZenNestChatbot/blob/main/README.md) on [GitHub](https://github.com/JasonPittsBusiness/ZenNestChatbot).
