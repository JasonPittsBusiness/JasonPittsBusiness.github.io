# Overview

<br>

If you're utilizing ServiceNow within your support environment and haven't yet explored the Virtual Agent Chatbot, it's definitely worth a look. Since deploying this innovative solution across various departments within an organization of over 60,000 users, we've observed a remarkable improvement in our support operations. The chatbot has enhanced the resolution rate of tier 1 support requests by 39% through automation. Additionally, in areas where the chatbot has been tested, we've seen a reduction of over 50% in the breach percentage of service level agreements (SLAs). While I cannot share specific organizational resources or detailed infographics, I'm excited to guide you through the process of creating and deploying this chatbot.

# The evolution of technology and IT support

<br>

Service areas are constantly bombarded with service requests from customers and stakeholders in an ever-growing technological future, ranging from tier 1 to specialized support needs. Enter the ServiceNow Virtual Agentâ€”an innovative chatbot that leverages natural language processing and seamless integration with this revolutionary platform to resolve customer issues asap.

# How does the chatbot help?

<br>

Built with a myriad of base template items you are ready to go out of the box. You can further train the bot on natural language responses and queries that will allow users to gain knowledge base articles, create tickets, connect to live service, or make API calls to resolve issues.

<br>

The API calls were the most exciting part to me as many issues can be scripted out into trees or have response base script trees when recognizing user language. Using orchestration services like Jenkins you can script API calls that initiate follow-up actions such as unlock a users account or VPN access in the event of being locked out.

# Conclusion

<br>

Deploying this chatbot in my environment has made an immense impact on the support areas that are currently using it. In an organization of over 60,000 users level 1 issues are common and frequent leading to reduced productivity from IT members. Automation of the involved processes and resolutions allows for greater efficient use of IT professionals time and leads to happier customers. While only some areas are testing currently rollout is happening organization wide and I am anticipating full rollout of the chatbot by FY26.
